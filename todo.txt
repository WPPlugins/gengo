2.5:
-----
Static Pages
Categories
Tags
Javascript variables.
Comment Feeds
get_terms instead of get_categories;
Tags pages - have to map translated slugs to underlying slugs.


2.Next:
-------

Bugs:
previous page doesn't take you to the third page.
in_category() problem possibly?
category_counts padded too much, probably doesn't respect hide_empty = false.
INSERT TABLE 'genericName' isn't allowed in FROM table list
subpages broken when links not appended.
feeds broken when links not appended.
"Gengo reports: 150 Romanian posts & 12 English posts
  Front page Gengo language switch reports: 89 Romanian posts & 12 English posts."
posts page not always visible in wp_list_pages.  Will be fixed with No Language posts.

Features:
user-specified inclusions like wp-cache.
Make inclusions exclusions regex based.
filter get_option_text_direction() (bloginfo_textdirection)
Filter on gengo_list_languages() to allow subdomain stuff.
autochange the spellchecker if possible...
autoload snippets like options.
Transalpin's language control (gengo list languages argument, make_primary...)
Default categories when creating a translation.
No language - still create a wp-post2lang entry, but set langauge to 0, or no entry?  Will fix lots of plugin based errors.
combined translation comments.
language_locale.php for each language locale - look at 2.1 for more info.
Better rtl.
?translation_group=23
make the_translations() more flexible.
context-localised strings.
- Role management: Editor cannot access â€œLanguagesâ€� screen, author can (solved?)

Cleanup:
move the caching into the_posts()
JS correctly scoped and sorted, because it's crap at the moment.
gengo.css
Improve JSON completion messages.
Remove deprecated functions.
Remove javascript from the wp_head and admin_head functions. use new js L10n stuff.
Category stuff to the category page, ui for descriptions





- â€œSave Summaryâ€� button gone
- Summaries donâ€™t show up on my blog! What am I doing wrong? (PHP4, MySQL 4.1. Your admin account is still active, if you want to check the templates.)
- While weâ€™re at it: Cannot display uploaded images (wrong forum?)
- <link hreflang> in header: urls to site.com without language codes probably wonâ€™t work. Should rewrite cookie (-> make primary)
- Edit screen: Gengo widget should appear on top of the sidebar by default
- Keep the list short: Do not allow posts to be marked as translations of pages (nor vice versa)
- Automatically adopt page order or categories for all translations
- Category synonyms for links donâ€™t work
- Links to archives: Category names in URLs always in primary language (if â€œdisplay in a combination of languagesâ€� is on): Site.com/archive/category_name_in_primary_language/
- language_contol doesnâ€™t append â€œ?language=â€� query string for mod_rewrite off


Future:
-------
drag and drop post languages.
blogging by email.
Summaries page to quickly edit summary groups.  Similar to synonyms, AJAX based, pull from
Smart summaries on the post screen. Major.
Store summary author in the database? Poll.
Merge translation and post group functions. Major.
Add post to existing translation group. Minor.
Summaries page. Major.
Change GETs to POSTs or look at nonces.
dbx language control box.
Auto update notification?  Matt Read + Red Alt?
WYSIWYG x2 Can't be easily done yet.  Significant refactoring to come in 2.1
